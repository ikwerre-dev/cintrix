🏥 ClinTrix AI — Responsible Emergency Room Optimization System

Tagline:
Explainable. Ethical. Efficient Emergency Care.


---

🧭 1. Overview

ClinTrix AI is a web-based emergency department optimization tool powered by Google Gemini AI.
It helps hospitals reduce overcrowding, improve triage accuracy, predict patient inflow, and optimize staff and bed allocation — while maintaining Responsible AI principles like transparency, fairness, privacy, and human oversight.

This system empowers triage teams and hospital administrators with AI-assisted recommendations that are always explainable, auditable, and human-approved.


---

🎯 2. Problem Statement

Hospitals like Metro General face:

⏱ 8+ hour wait times for non-critical patients

😩 Staff burnout from poor scheduling and overload

💸 Millions lost annually due to untreated patient dropouts

⚖️ Inequitable triage outcomes influenced by language or bias


There is an urgent need for a responsible AI assistant that improves patient flow and triage efficiency without compromising ethics or safety.


---

💡 3. Solution Overview

ClinTrix AI provides an AI-driven triage and resource management platform that:

Classifies patient cases (Critical, Urgent, Non-Urgent)

Predicts patient inflow and wait times

Suggests staffing reallocation

Explains every AI recommendation clearly

Logs all actions for transparency and auditing


This solution reduces delays, improves care quality, and ensures AI decisions remain fair, transparent, and clinician-supervised.

⚙️ 7. Tech Stack & Architecture

Frontend: React (Vite or CRA) + TailwindCSS
Backend: Node.js + Express
AI Model: Google Gemini 1.5
Data: In-memory JSON or Firebase
Deployment: Vercel / Heroku / Firebase Hosting

Core Components:

IntakeForm.jsx

QueueBoard.jsx

ExplainabilityPanel.jsx

StaffingWidget.jsx

AuditTrail.jsx


APIs:

POST /api/intake        → Add new patient
POST /api/predict       → Get AI triage suggestion
GET  /api/queue         → Fetch patient queue
POST /api/confirm       → Confirm or override AI output
GET  /api/audit         → Fetch audit log

Architecture Flow:

User Input → Gemini AI → AI Output (Urgency + Reason)
                 ↓
          Human Review → Queue Update → Audit Log


---

🔒 8. Responsible AI Principles

1. Transparency: Every AI recommendation includes plain-language reasoning.


2. Privacy: No patient-identifiable data stored (anonymized demo).


3. Fairness: Neutral prompts — exclude race, language, or income bias.


4. Human Oversight: Clinicians must confirm all AI outputs.


5. Explainability: Feature contributions visible per decision.


6. Fail-safe: AI offline → human-only mode enabled.

🧩 10. Example Gemini Prompts

Triage Prompt

You are a hospital triage AI assistant.
Given the following patient data:
Age: 55
Symptoms: chest pain, nausea, dizziness
Vitals: BP 160/95, HR 110 bpm
Classify as Critical, Moderate, or Low urgency.
Explain your reasoning in 1-2 sentences.

Resource Prompt

You are an ER operations AI.
If patient inflow is 40/hour and staff count is 8, suggest staffing adjustments and explain your reasoning.
